<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>My name is Srija Uppuluri, and I’m a second-year engineering student in CSE-branch at The National Institute of Engineering, Mysore. I’m currently diving deep into the world of web development, where I’m learning to build responsive, user-friendly websites using technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and frameworks such as React. I’m passionate about creating digital experiences that are both functional and visually engaging, and I’m constantly exploring new tools and techniques to sharpen my skills.<p/>
<p>Studying engineering has helped me develop a strong analytical mindset and a problem-solving approach that I bring into every project I work on. Whether it’s debugging code or designing intuitive interfaces, I enjoy the challenge of transforming ideas into working solutions. I’m also a collaborative learner, always eager to connect with peers, share knowledge, and grow through teamwork.<p/>
<p>Beyond academics, I’m fascinated by UI/UX design, emerging tech trends, and the evolving role of web applications in shaping how we interact with the digital world. I’m currently working on personal projects to build my portfolio and looking forward to gaining hands-on experience through internships and real-world collaborations. This portfolio is a reflection of my journey as a learner, creator, and aspiring developer—and I’m excited about the road ahead.</p>
